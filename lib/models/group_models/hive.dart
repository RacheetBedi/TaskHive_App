/*Two scenarios:

1. Hive is created from scratch. In this case, I want to call the following:
  1. HiveRepository, to make the hive document in Firestore
*/

/*

can I do this sort of structure for when I want to create my hives? for example, should I
use a new provider for hives, keeping track of the hive data, and use hiveProvider.createNewFirestoreHive
or something of the sort, which then references my hiveRepository? Or is this overly complex;
is riverpod useful for hives (which are my 'groups', similar to canvas classes).
